You play as Margarine Walker, a butterfly with the ability to time travel (like all butterflies).
The game takes place over the course of 10 minutes in real time where your job is to touch as many employee's lives as possible, for better or for worse. 
Helping everyone in just 10 minutes will not be possible. To assist in this endeavor you can restart the 10 minutes at any time by pausing the game or waiting for the time to run out.
As a butterfly, your actions are always paradoxical. As such, every time you go back in time, your actions will be repeated. This is exactly how, by beating their wings, butterflies cause hurricanes.
Go and maximize your butterfly effect, new employee.
