queen_bee_character: I have handed in my resignation in a most professional manner, hehehe. Since I have already finished packing and waiting on Vinny, I took the liberty of booking a three week stay at the San FranfishcoÂ´s International Resort Hotel. 
queen_bee_character: Vinny is not a man who has had the opportunity to enjoy the ""luxuries of life"" so I hope he will love it. The view is to die for and the weather this time of year in the U.S (United Sardines) is positivly divine!
