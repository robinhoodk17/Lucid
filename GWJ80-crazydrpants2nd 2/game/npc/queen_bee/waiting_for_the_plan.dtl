queen_bee_character: Oh honey, if you can... Go speak with [color = red] the security guard [/color] as well. We need to find someone to replace my Vinny too. CanÂ´t have him run away with me without a replacement planned out. 
queen_bee_character: That would not be professional of me, not at all. So speak with Barry and the security guard as soon as possiple if you would be a dear.
