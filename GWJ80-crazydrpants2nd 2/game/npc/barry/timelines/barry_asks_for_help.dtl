barry_character: Hello hello hello! Margarine Walker was it? It is a pleasure to meet you. You might not know me but I knew your parents, upstanding folks who knew how to run a business without misstreating us worker bees and worker ants.
barry_character: I am Barry Bargains, head of a 1 ant union, and I got a proposal for you. See Ms Walker, I am currently working out a deal with Ms Bees regarding insect insurance and housing, see?
barry_character: And let's just say that I might have gotten a little heated during a meeting or two and now the other power players at the company are refusing to speak to me.
barry_character: Well, that is where you come in! Convince the current  [color=red] CFO, Head of HR, and CEO [/color]to hear ol' Barry out and I will be in your debt.
barry_character: Also, I have been trying to get [color=red] the 3 bees [/color] to form a union for years, without any success.
barry_character: Think of it as a chance to earn some practical experience in the cutthroat world of finance. What a bargain!
